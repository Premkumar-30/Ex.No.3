##  Aim

To design an AI-powered travel assistant chatbot that helps users plan trips, book hotels, and check weather conditions. The chatbot should manage diverse queries efficiently while maintaining a natural and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we apply scenario-based prompting techniques such as straightforward prompting, tabular format prompting, and preceding question prompting to simulate real-world use cases.
